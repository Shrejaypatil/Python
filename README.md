## 📂 Repository Structure

The repository is organized into several key sections:

### 1. 📊 Datatypes
This folder contains Python scripts demonstrating how to work with different data types, including:
- **Integers**
- **Floats**
- **Strings**
- **Lists**
- **Tuples**
- **Sets**
- **Dictionaries**

Learn the differences and common operations you can perform on these data types to get a solid foundation in Python.

### 2. 🏗 OOPs (Object-Oriented Programming)
The OOP section introduces object-oriented concepts in Python, such as:
- **Classes** & **Objects**
- **Inheritance**
- **Polymorphism**
- **Encapsulation**
- **Abstraction**

You'll find examples demonstrating how to use Python's OOP capabilities to write clean, modular, and reusable code.

### 3. 📐 Array Manipulation
The **Array Manipulation** folder includes tutorials and examples on handling arrays and matrices using Python:
- **Creating arrays** using `NumPy`
- **Array slicing** and **indexing**
- **Mathematical operations** on arrays
- **Reshaping** and **resizing**
- **Merging**, **splitting**, and **iterating** over arrays

Arrays and matrices are fundamental when working with data science, scientific computing, and machine learning.

### 4. ✂️ String Manipulation
Learn how to manipulate strings efficiently with this section. It covers:
- **String concatenation**
- **Substring extraction**
- **String formatting**
- Working with **string methods** (`split()`, `join()`, `replace()`, etc.)
- **Regular expressions** for pattern matching

String manipulation is a vital skill in text processing, web development, and data analysis.
